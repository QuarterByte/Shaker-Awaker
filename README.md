# Shaker-Awaker
For many heavy sleepers, waking up to an alarm clock is daunting. With the Shaker Awaker, you can put your worries aside, as it is a surefire way to wake you from your slumber.

I originally devised the idea for the Shaker Awaker because I would sleep through all my alarms. No matter how many I set or how loud the alarm was, I would find a way to turn it off half asleep and wake up late. However, this design will force you out of bed, as it triggers a motor which will vibrate until it senses that you have left the bed.
